  <h3> Asia </h3>
 <p> Asia (/ˈeɪʒə, ˈeɪʃə/ (About this soundlisten)) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. 
 It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.
 Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. 
 The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[5] was the site of many of the first civilizations. <p> 
 Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. 
 Its 4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.[6] </p>
 <p>In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. 
 The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. 
 It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. 
 The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. <p> 
 The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, 
 the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe.[7] </p>
